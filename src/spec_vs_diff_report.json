  "summary": "The diff implements the requested post-checkout order-details auto-display via the confirmation page, adds a required payment method selection with an online payment deep link and optional transaction reference appended into order notes (frontend-only, no backend changes), and adds an optional Rapido pickup helper on the post-order screen with a Rapido deep link and copy-to-clipboard pickup note. No unrequested features are clearly evidenced beyond these requirements.",
